Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction

This study is a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of credit card application approvals. In the project, I used a multi-stage approach including data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and ensemble methods. Initially, two separate datasets (application records and credit records) were merged and thoroughly preprocessed. Using feature engineering techniques, I created a scenario, derived new features from existing data, and developed a credit scoring system. Using this scoring system, I obtained a Target Label according to the scenario. Various machine learning models were tested, and the best-performing models were selected for hyperparameter optimization. Using the best models, I evaluated ensemble methods, chose the best method to combine the models, and finally addressed the class imbalance issue to create the final model.
